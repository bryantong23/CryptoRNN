# CryptoRNN

Recurrent Neural Network created to predict various cryptocurrency prices. Formatted, normalized, randomized,
sequentialized, data in order to be fed into neural network. RNN ultimately consisted of three 128 LTSM layers and one 32 Dense layer, all using ReLU activation function. Best result was BCH, with training and validation accuracy approaching 60% and training and validation loss approaching 65%.
